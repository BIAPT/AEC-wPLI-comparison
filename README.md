# Envelope- and phase-based measures of functional connectivity are complementary in the classification of states of consciousness
This repository is for the study of AEC vs wPLI functional connectivity metric and their relation to the classification of consciousness. 

## Repository Structure
In this repository we have adopted a iterative milestone approach. Meaning that the code was built and improved by trying to hit a clear objecive than make the analysis better. The most up to date analysis is the one with the highest integer prefix, but all previous iteration are present to ensure that all prior experiments are available without going back into the git history.

# Envelope- and phase-based measures of functional connectivity are complementary in the classification of states of consciousness
This repository is for the study of AEC vs wPLI functional connectivity metric and their relation to the classification of consciousness. 

## Repository Structure
In this repository we have adopted a iterative milestone approach. Meaning that the code was built and improved by trying to hit a clear objecive than make the analysis better. The most up to date analysis is the one with the highest integer prefix, but all previous iteration are present to ensure that all prior experiments are available without going back into the git history.

### Milestones
0. First Attempt at Classification: this is the code used to generate the result for the first draft of the paper sent out for review.
1. MAIN 2019 Poster Presentation: this analysis was presentated at the Montreal Artificial Intelligence Neuroscience conference. We looked at adding graph features to the classification to see if they helped improved the performance.
2. OHBM 2020 Poster Presentation : this analysis was presented at OHBM and was focused on the binarized vs non-binarized graph. This work build upon what was presented at the MAIN conference.
3. Human Brain Mapping Journal Submission: this analysis build on the one presented at OHBM in terms of methodology, but will be solely focused on the functional connectivity metrics.
